<h1>Welcome to The Suicide Squad</h1>
<p class="mission">In the shadowy corridors of government secrecy, Amanda Waller, a woman feared even by the most powerful, devises a ruthless plan. With metahuman threats on the rise and no superheroes willing to intervene, she assembles a team that no one will mourn—the worst of the worst.</p>
<p class="squad">Enter Task Force X, an unlikely alliance of criminals bound by desperation. Deadshot, the hitman who never misses. Harley Quinn, the chaos-driven lover of Gotham’s most feared villain. El Diablo, haunted by his own fire-drenched sins. Killer Croc, the monster lurking beneath the sewers. Captain Boomerang, unpredictable but deadly. And Rick Flag, their unwilling leader with his own fragile motivations.</p>  
<p class="mission">Their mission? To neutralize an ancient and uncontrollable force—the Enchantress, a sorceress who was meant to be controlled but has now turned against humanity, raising a supernatural army in the ruins of Midway City.</p>
<p class="mission">Dropped into a devastated war zone, the squad must fight their way through phantom-like creatures, knowing full well they’re expendable—one wrong move, and Waller will detonate the explosives implanted in their necks.

But as they push deeper into the city, the illusion of their mission begins to crack. The truth? They weren’t sent to save anyone. They were meant to die, clearing the way for the government’s true interests. Betrayal lingers in the air, and the squad—criminals who trust no one—must now choose between survival and defiance.

The battle against Enchantress reaches its peak in an abandoned skyscraper, where each squad member faces their inner demons. Diablo, refusing to lose control again, embraces his monstrous nature, unleashing his fiery rage. Deadshot, haunted by his daughter’s voice, lands the perfect kill shot. Harley, ever the trickster, distracts the sorceress long enough for the final blow to be struck.</p>
